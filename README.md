# UserInputBasicMath
Functions That Take User Input and Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations

This package takes user input and performs basic arithmetic operations 
    that the user selects. The input is at the user discretion, i.e., it can be a set of 
    numbers such as 10, 20, 30 + 1, 2, 3, or it can be a single pair of numbers, i.e., 
    12 + 10. If the user inputs multiple numbers into a set, then the arithmetic operation 
    selected will be using the sum of that set. For example, if a user inputs 1, 2, 3 * 
    20, 2, 1 then the operation that will be performed will be done as 6 * 23. 
    There are five operations that can be selected using this package. 
    A user can choose to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
    and modulus. An important thing to note, and the package will also correct you 
    if you attempt to do this, is that the set of numbers need to be an equal amount. 
    For example, if a user inputs 12, 10 / 1, this will result in an error and a 
    message will be shown asking the user to re-enter values. This package also contains
    a second function that follows the same principles as above, but it takes user
    assigned vectors instead of user input. All rules still apply when using this function.
    The details and application of UserInputToMath and VectorInputToMath are in the 
    documentation.
